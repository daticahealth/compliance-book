            h2.headline-3 Regulated companies have a hard problem to solve.
            .font-serif.font-light
                p They run the risk of becoming obsolete due to an inability to adopt new technology fast enough. Incumbent business models will be out-flanked by shifting customer expectations brought on by improved digital experiences. Market conditions are out of their control. Even healthcare, the most regulated industry with the heartiest entrenchment and uniquely perverse economic incentives, is remarkably close to complete upheaval due to a litany of world-changing ideas, like mobile devices, Internet of Things, big data, and artificial intelligence. It all stems from the mother of all recent innovations, the cloud. The root challenge is the adoption of cloud computing in order to remain relevant. If achieved, compliant cloud computing becomes an organizational differentiator.
                
                p Compliance contributes to this existential threat because it prompts the cloud to be viewed as a liable cost center by most regulated companies. But that’s wrong. It’s actually a leverageable asset that is at the foundation of modern business transformation. 
                
                p Complete Cloud Compliance is a program developed after years of managing high-stakes compliance requirements across mission critical healthcare workloads. It is a chance to control destiny. The program is written for healthcare organizations, but all while under the principle that best practices are best practices, meaning the insights shared can be applied across global regimes and any industry.

                    span.headline-4 The Business Case for Compliance
                    p The most regulated industries are often the most important to society, but they are also the farthest behind on absorbing new technology. The cloud is a critical requirement for regulated companies to avoid disruption. Compliance blocks cloud adoption, but it doesn't have to be that way. If organizations change their approach to compliance, they can unlock the cloud and turn what used to be a liability into a true differentiating asset.

                    span.headline-4 What <em>Really</em> is Compliance?
                    p Most technologists have little experience with compliance. This chapter goes deep on compliance in a way developers can understand.

                    span.headline-4 What <em>Really</em> is the Cloud?
                    p Most compliance officers have a hard time keeping up with the fast-paced, dynamic nature of the cloud. The shifting landscape of abstraction only makes it harder. This chapter goes deep on the cloud in a way that business-minded compliance owners can understand.
                li
                    span.headline-4 Why Data Interoperability Matters
                    p Cloud compliance is about managing security and privacy of data. Fundamental to modern business models is integration of disparate datasets, which subsequently increases compliance complexity for regulated companies.

                    span.headline-4 Complete Cloud Compliance
                    p The meat of the book is a 3C program designed for any regulated company looking to control compliance on the cloud with an eye on the future. The program explains the overlay of compliance and cloud abstraction, then gives a rubric for creating your own program.

                    span.headline-4 The Achievable Mandate
                    p Adopting the cloud isn't something you <em>should</em> do—it's something you <em>must</em> do. Compliance isn't something you ought to do, but the right thing to do. Combining them is a mandate, but the good news is it's entirely possible to achieve.
